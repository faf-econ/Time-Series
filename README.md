Intertemporal Choice: A review of the Discount Functions and its
implications
================

May 2018

This work has three main goals. First, review three different discount
models: the Exponential Discount Function, The Hyperbolic Discount
Function and the Quasi-Hyperbolic Discount Function. The different
features of these three models have different implications to deal with
anomalies found empirically. Second, show how time inconsistency and
decreasing discount rates affect decision making, causing Present Bias
and Lack of Self Control. Finally, show how the latter two problems are
solved by self mechanisms.
